                    In the Spring of 2018, Esther and Soonho met at 
                    <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('upenn.jpg')" onmouseout="hide()">The University of Pennsylvania</a> 
                    when Soonho visited during Spring break.
                    <br><br>
                    Through a series of some serious moves, Soonho managed to convince Esther to spend some time 
                    with him in San Francisco that summer, and they had a great time visiting the 
                    <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('letterform.jpg')" onmouseout="hide()">Letterform Archive</a> 
                    and doing a 
                    <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('songTea.jpg')" onmouseout="hide()">tea tasting</a>. 
                    Esther decided to come visit Soonho in Pittsburgh when school 
                    started in the Fall (allegedly, Esther had always wanted to visit Pittsburgh, 
                    but Soonho still thinks she just wanted to see him).
                    <br><br>
                    Early Fall 2018, Esther visited Soonho at 
                    <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('placeholder.png')" onmouseout="hide()">CMU</a>.  
                    They explored different neighborhoods around Pittsburgh, checked out 
                    <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('placeholder.png')" onmouseout="hide()">Phipps conservatory</a>, 
                    and went on their first official date. Due to an unfortunate stomach ache, the date actually only lasted 15min, 
                    but by then Soonho and Esther knew enough about each other to make the decision to enter a relationship. They 
                    <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('placeholder.png')" onmouseout="hide()">started dating</a>  
                    on 10/11/2018!!
                    <br><br>
                    For the rest of senior year, Esther and Soonho would be dating long distance but 
                    would try to see each other as much as possible—braving the 7hr greyhound both ways 
                    just to spend a weekend together. They would frequent the likes of <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('elixr.jpg')" onmouseout="hide()">Elixr Coffee</a>, 
                    Han Dynasty, and 
                    <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('waffleonia.jpg')" onmouseout="hide()">Waffelonia</a>. 
                    The year ended with Soonho coming to Penn to take 
                    <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('placeholder.png')" onmouseout="hide()">Esther’s graduation photos</a>!
                    <br><br>
                    After graduating, Esther moved to 
                    <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('placeholder.png')" onmouseout="hide()">New York</a> 
                    for work and Soonho went back home to the 
                    <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('placeholder.png')" onmouseout="hide()">Bay Area</a>. 
                    They visited each other as often as 
                    they could, but in early 2020 their plans were put on pause due COVID. Through many video calls and one epic 
                    <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('placeholder.png')" onmouseout="hide()">national parks road trip</a>, 
                    they made it through the bulk of the pandemic, and they started planning on how they could live in close 
                    proximity for the first time in their relationship.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, after 3 long years of long distance dating, Esther and Soonho moved to 
                    San Francisco. Their relationship kept growing as they built 
                    a <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('community.jpg')" onmouseout="hide()">community in the city</a>, found a church, 
                    <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('travel.jpg')" onmouseout="hide()">traveled</a>, 
                    and of course 
                    <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('climbing.jpg')" onmouseout="hide()">did a lot of rock climbing</a>. 
                    <br><br>
                    June of 2023, Esther and Soonho went on a trip to Iceland with their good friends 
                    <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('brian-angela.jpg')" onmouseout="hide()">Brian and Angela</a>. 
                    Over the course of 12 days, this group drove the whole Ring Road, 
                    including the West Fjords. They saw 
                    <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('sights.jpg')" onmouseout="hide()">magnificent sights</a> 
                    and ate far too much lamb soup, 
                    but the trip ultimately culminated on June 13, the fateful day that 
                    <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('proposal.jpg')" onmouseout="hide()">Soonho proposed</a> to Esther  
                    <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('dynjandi.jpg')" onmouseout="hide()">under the Dynjandi Falls</a>. 
                    Thankfully, Esther said yes, and now they are 
                    <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('placeholder.png')" onmouseout="hide()">happily engaged</a>!
                    <br><br>
                    Esther and Soonho are so thankful to be spending their wedding day with so many people 
                    who have supported them throughout their lives and relationship. They hope to continue 
                    receiving such support as they enter into this new chapter!
