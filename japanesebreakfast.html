                    In the Spring of 2018, Esther and Soonho met at <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('upenn.jpg')" onmouseout="hide()">The University of Pennsylvania</a> when Soonho visited during Spring break.
                    <br><br>
                    Through a series of some serious moves, Soonho managed to convince Esther to spend some time 
                    with him in San Francisco that summer, and they had a great time visiting the <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('letterform.jpg')" onmouseout="hide()">Letterform Archive</a> 
                    and doing a <a class="p-links" href="" onmouseover = "show('songTea.jpg')" onmouseout="hide()">tea tasting</a>. Esther decided to come visit Soonho in Pittsburgh when school 
                    started in the Fall (allegedly, Esther had always wanted to visit Pittsburgh, 
                    but Soonho still thinks she just wanted to see him).

                    For the rest of senior year, Esther and Soonho would be dating long distance but 
                    would try to see each other as much as possible—braving the 7hr greyhound both ways 
                    just to spend a weekend together. They would frequent the likes of Elixr Coffee, 
                    Han Dynasty, and Waffelonia. The year ended with Esther and Soonho attending 
                    each others’ senior design showcases!

                    Finally, after 3 long years of long distance dating, Esther and Soonho moved to 
                    San Francisco. Their relationship would continue to grow and develop as they built 
                    a community in the city, find a church, travel, and ultimately spend a lot more 
                    time together doing mundane everyday things. 
                    <br><br>
                    June of 2023, Esther and Soonho went on a trip to Iceland with their good friends 
                    Brian and Angela. Over the course of 12 days, this group drove the whole Ring Road, 
                    including the West Fjords. They saw magnificent sights and ate far too much lamb soup, 
                    but the trip ultimately culminated on June 13, the fateful day that Soonho proposed 
                    to Esther under the Dynjandi Falls. Thankfully, Esther said yes, and now they are 
                    happily engaged!
                    <br><br>
                    Esther and Soonho are so thankful to be spending their wedding day with so many people 
                    who have supported them throughout their lives and relationship. They hope to continue 
                    receiving such support as they enter into this new chapter!
