        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Esther and Soonho met at The University of Pennsylvania in Spring 2018.
                Though Soonho doesn’t quite remember it...
                <br>
                <br>
                Esther visited Pittsburgh once senior year started. And to this day, she claims 
                she just wanted to visit Pittsburgh. Soonho hardly believes that. She also made him a 
                mixtape. She was very into making mixtapes and using the risograph machine at the time. 
                On their first date, Esther had a really bad stomach ache so they just boxed up the food 
                they ordered. Soonho made some funny doodles about a turtle to make her feel better. 
                This trip proved to be a core memory! They started dating shortly after.
                <br>
                <br>
                Esther and Soonho did long distance for most of their relationship! 3 years! They 
                finally moved to San Francisco in 2021 and have been there since.
