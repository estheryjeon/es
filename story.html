    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>
        Esther and Soonho met at The University of Pennsylvania in Spring 2018.
        Though Soonho doesn’t quite remember it...
        <br>
        <br>
        Esther visited Pittsburgh once senior year started. And to this day, she claims 
        she just wanted to visit Pittsburgh. Soonho hardly believes that. She also made him a 
        mixtape. She was very into making mixtapes and using the risograph machine at the time. 
        On their first date, Esther had a really bad stomach ache so they just boxed up the food 
        they ordered. Soonho made some funny doodles about a turtle to make her feel better. 
        This trip proved to be a core memory! They started dating shortly after.
        <br>
        <br>
        Esther and Soonho did long distance for most of their relationship! 3 years! They 
        finally moved to San Francisco in 2021 and have been there since.
