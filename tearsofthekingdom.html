                <p>Hilary’s good friend Soonho asked her senior year if she would keep his visiting girlfriend company (read: babysit) over the weekend while he was serving as 1 of 2 go-to event photographers at Carnegie Mellon, and Hilary thought, sure why not?</p>

                <p>From sharing secrets on the (no-longer-existent) Hill patio to sharing Spotify playlists on the way to Storm King Art Center, they’ve been connected since day 1 with a bond that can only be attributed to Jesus!!</p>

                <p>As fate would have it, Soonho was the last chair cellist for the El Camino Youth Orchestra, and Frank was the only bassist, meaning they were always adjacent to each other.</p>

                <p>Their shared experiences have been quite eclectic to say the least – meeting Japanese Breakfast after a random festival in NYC, driving to Sonic in Dallas to try exploding boba (& being utterly disappointed…), wearing plastic bags at a Busan baseball game to fit in with the locals.</p>

                <p>When they were younger, Julie often visited Esther in Dallas during summer break, and they would huddle by the computer to play Jackfrost and Flash Flash Revolution (both epic computer games), watch live Big Bang performances on Youtube, and download lots and lots of music (via Limewire-–sorry FBI) on to their 3rd generation iPod Nanos (back when Apple products were superior). </p>

                <p>In the late summer of 2011, Michael arrived at the annual El Camino Youth Symphony season kick-off camp with a mission: to adopt a new little boy named Soonho. Let the record show that when they first met, Michael was the taller one.</p>
